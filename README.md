# Linchpin
A web tool that helps organisation to analyse their workforce.

This is one of my btech project that helps bigger organisations to make better sense out of their workforce. A big organisation keeps hiring and firing a lot of people. But this entire process costs them much. Hence Linchpin helps them to analyse their workforce and helps them to moniter their workforce. This helps them to understand what skills are really expected from their employees. This also helps them to know when to hire. During recession this application gives the best way to fire the employees and cut down costs in such a way that the productivity of the company is greatly retained.
